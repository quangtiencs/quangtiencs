Hi, this is quangtiencsâ€™s log, a homepage of my engineering life. I am Tien Le-Quang (LÃª Quang Tiáº¿n), a ËˆdeÉªtÉ™ dÉªËˆtektÉªv (a.k.a data detective or data scientist).

### Primary interests:

- Real-world applications: PCausal reasoning, Search system.
- Machine learning methodologies: Bayesian Inference, Probabilistic Deep Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models.
- Algorithm for optimizations: Bandit Algorithms, Constraint Programming (CP-SAT problem).

### Tech Stack:

- Programming languages: Python, Julia, Javascript, C++17 (and a little bit of R, Scala)
- Machine learning frameworks: Tensorflow (and Tensorflow Probability), Stan, LightGBM, Scikit-Learn.
- Good at data visualizations. Visualization Libraries: d3js, bokeh, matplotlib.
